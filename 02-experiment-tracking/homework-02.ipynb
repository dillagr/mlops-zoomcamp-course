    "The results from the hyperparameter optimization are quite good. So, we can assume that we are ready to test some of these models in production. In this exercise, you'll promote the best model to the model registry. We have prepared a script called register_model.py, which will check the results from the previous step and select the top 5 runs. After that, it will calculate the RMSE of those models on the test set (March 2023 data) and save the results to a new experiment called random-forest-best-models.\n",

    "Your task is to update the script register_model.py so that it selects the model with the lowest RMSE on the test set and registers it to the model registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 1: you can use the method search_runs from the MlflowClient to get the model with the lowest RMSE,\n",

    "Tip 2: to register the model you can use the method mlflow.register_model and you will need to pass the right model_uri in the form of a string that looks like this: \"runs:/<RUN_ID>/model\", and the name of the model (make sure to choose a good one!).\n",
